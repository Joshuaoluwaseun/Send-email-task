Node Mailer Task

I created a Nodemailer(the email sender package in NodeJs) task. I used it to send an email using node-js.

Before then I created a new Project for my node mailer in google cloud,
I went to the credentials and added my gmail, registered as a web application,
I configured the settings for my new OAUTH SETTINGS,
I created and got a client id that will enable my get my refresh token in the future,
I created a new OAUTH Refresh token using my gmail.
I went to developers.google.com/oauthplay ground, I pasted my client Id and client secret there
then I was able to get my Refresh token.

Secondly,
I created a simple node application that can send send emails,
I installed some npm packages like (dotenv, nodemailer, express) 
I required them to use it for my application
I created the API and then it went through
When I tested using the terminal, it returned a successful message!
I pasted the screen shots below so that you can view
